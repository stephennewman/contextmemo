# No V2 UI

The V2 UI (`app/v2/`, `components/v2/`) is **deprecated and no longer in use**. Do not build features, fix bugs, or make changes targeting the V2 layout or components.

## Active UI paths

- **Dashboard layout**: `app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`
- **Dashboard components**: `components/dashboard/`
- **Brand settings**: `app/(dashboard)/brands/[brandId]/settings/page.tsx`
- **Dashboard header**: `components/dashboard/dashboard-header.tsx`

## Deprecated (do not touch)

- `app/v2/` — all routes
- `components/v2/` — all components (sidebar, usage bar, etc.)

When the user refers to "settings", "dashboard", or any UI page, always target the `app/(dashboard)/` routes and `components/dashboard/` components.
